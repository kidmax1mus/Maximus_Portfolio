              <h5><span class="text-brand"> Skills Acquired in Computer Studies</span></h5>

<h4> <span class="text-brand"> Programming Skills</span></h4>

<p class="lead mt-2 mt-4">As part of your computer studies, you likely gained proficiency in programming languages such as Html5, C, Python, and others. 
  These skills enabled me to write, test, and debug code, which is fundamental for software development, web development, and various IT roles.</p>

<h5> <span class="text-brand"> Problem-Solving Abilities</span></h5>
<p class="lead mt-2 mt-4">Computer studies often emphasize problem-solving. I've learned how to approach complex technical challenges,
   break them down into manageable components, and develop solutions. Problem-solving skills are invaluable in the IT field.</p>

<h5> <span class="text-brand"> Technical Proficiency</span></h5>
<p class="lead mt-2 mt-4">Throughout my programming journey, I've gained technical expertise in various areas of computer science, including hardware and 
  software. This knowledge can include networking, database management, and system administration, making you adept
   at configuring and maintaining computer systems.</p>

                    class="d-none d-lg-block rounded-circle"
                    alt=""
                  />

                  <h4> <span class="text-brand">Goal Achievement</span></h4>
                  <p class="lead mt-2 mt-4">To reach your goals, it's crucial to plan ahead by writing them down.
                    Chapter 4 of "Twelve Pillars" emphasizes setting goals in advance and developing strategies to 
                    achieve them. Putting your goals on paper not only challenges you but also motivates you to work towards 
                    your future.</p>
          
                  <h4> <span class="text-brand">Effective Time Management</span></h4>
                  <p class="lead mt-2 mt-4">Chapter 5 stresses the importance of valuing time, considering it as a precious 
                    resource that should not be squandered. Many people often spend time on unimportant tasks, leading to poor
                     time management. Time is irreplaceable, so prioritizing essential tasks leads to a stress-free and fulfilling 
                     life, ensuring no regrets in the end.</p>
          
                  <h4> <span class="text-brand">Influential Connections <span class="text-brand"></span></h4>
                  <p class="lead mt-2 mt-4">Your companions play a significant role in shaping your personality and potential.
                     The people you associate with define who you are. It's vital to maintain positive relationships with goal-driven 
                     individuals who inspire and motivate you to improve.</p>
          
                  <h4> <span class="text-brand">Lifelong Learning</span></h4>
                  <p class="lead mt-2 mt-4">Continuous self-education is essential for personal growth and development in both health 
                    and spirit. Life is an ongoing learning process, and every day provides opportunities to acquire new knowledge. One 
                    effective way to be a lifelong learner is by reading books and observing successful individuals.</p>
